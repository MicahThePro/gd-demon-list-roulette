 * The session token is held in localStorage rather than only in a cookie: the
 * site is served from GitHub Pages, so the Worker is a third-party origin and
 * modern browsers will not attach its cookie to the site's own requests. The
 * token therefore travels in an Authorization header on every call. The Worker
 * also sets a SameSite=Lax cookie, which is only a fallback for the reload case.

 * the loader produced 'AREDL', so every AREDL run was silently treated as an
 * unranked list and could not be submitted at all.
